# Cosmos

This is the RESTful, serverless backend for Cosmos. It runs on AWS Lambda and MongoDB.

**Note**: The `serverless.yml` file has not been updated yet. It will be soon. THIS IS NOT DEPLOYABLE YET.

## Handlers

All handlers are defined inside the `src` directory. The only python files that it contains should be handlers. Anything else, _including tests_, should be a submodule of the `src` directory.
